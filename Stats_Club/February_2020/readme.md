# Stats Club 12/02/2020 
Hi all,

Thanks for such a wonderful turnout for the first Stats Club for 2020! It was nice to see so many familiar faces and some new ones in our group. Having the opportunity to guide the direction of the club as an entire group was incredibly useful as the club is run by students, for the benefit of students. 

Some of the topics discussed:
 1. The new structure of how sessions will run. Stats Club + Hacky Hour is still run fortnightly, but sessions will alternate between the two. The next meeting (26/02/2020) will be a Hacky Hour, at which I'll present an intro to R and a quick session on making pretty graphs using the package ggplot2.
 2. Engagement with the La Trobe Statistics platform. Last year I reached out to them and they're keen to provide tutors for teaching sessions at Stats Club. It seems that most of us deal with either genomic data or multivariate data and would like help in analysing it. I was absolutely bombarded with suggestions of what people would like to get expert advice on! Here's the list:
   * Experimental design
   * Power analysis
   * Post-hoc tests (LSDs, Tukey, Duncan, etc)
   * Parametric vs. non-parametric testing
    
I'm looking forward to the next session! Hopefully everyone has their laptops ready to go!

Kind regards,
Charlotte
