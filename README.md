# About the Club

AgriBio Stats Club + Hacky Hour meetings will link graduate researchers with career researchers from Agriculture Victoria and La Trobe University in an informal, peer learning environment to promote best practice statistics in biology.

Participants will take turns in lead meetings with a topic of their choosing. Meetings are run fortnightly, but it is up to participants how often theyâ€™d like to attend.

Stats club is a fantastic opportunity to expose researchers to a wider range of statistical analyses and experimental techniques than the purview of their research topic. It is anticipated that the mentors themselves will also benefit from a collegiate atmosphere in which to explore the statistical dimensions of their field of research.

The aim is to provide participants with a deeper understanding of these techniques to enhance their research capabilities. Further, it will allow us to undertake and understand their own statistical analyses, which we can then present to the group for review. This can be followed up with additional assistance from more expert resources as required, ultimately resulting in better design and analyses of experiments, better theses, and research papers.


## How the sessions are run

At the beginning of each session, the presenter tells the group what their experiment aims to achieve and the experimental techniques used, including how the data is measured. Then they might show where they have reached in their analysis, or describe how they are stuck. The conversation evolves from there. It is very informal and is intended to give people new avenues to pursue, not necessarily to solve their problem and definitely not to analyse their results (unless interpretation is the issue!). Sometimes people want to share knowledge they have about statistical methods too. Any exchange of information about statistics is welcome at Stats Club.

 

## Other Resources

[La Trobe Digital Research](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/research-infrastructure/digital-research/training-and-events) - Training courses for Excel, R, Python, UNIX, etc. Free to attend, just complete the Expression of Interest form!

[Laerd Statistics](https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/one-way-anova-using-spss-statistics.php) - This is geared towards SPSS, but goes into the theory of various statistical tests in an accessible way.

[Modern Statistics for the Modern Biology](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/) - Suggested by Alex (thanks!) as reading material for beginner statisticians.

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - This is written by the chief scientist of RStudio, Hadley Wickham, whose philosophy is that the data analysis comes first, and coding is learnt along the way.

[Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) - A fantastic resource for selecting appropriate graphs depending on your data. Also provides code necessary to produce the graph in various languages.
